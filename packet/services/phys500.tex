We've gained access to a probe stationed in Alpha Centauri. You'll need to use it to look around for information that may be useful. The space that the probe has access to is mapped to the physical space of Building 26 at MIT. You should only need to search in publicly accessible portions of the building. (Hallways and Stairwells) Please do not touch or remove the information you find.
